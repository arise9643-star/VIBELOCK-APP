                        Hey there! I'm Arnav Krishna, the creator of Grinder. As a developer and productivity enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by how we can leverage technology to help people work smarter, not harder.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-text">
                        The idea for Grinder came from my own struggles with maintaining focus during long coding sessions and remote collaboration. I wanted to build something that combines the simplicity of the Pomodoro technique with the power of real-time collaboration and data-driven insights.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio-text">
                        This platform is my attempt to create the ultimate productivity tool—one that doesn't just track time, but helps you understand your work patterns, stay accountable, and continuously improve. Whether you're a solo creator or part of a team, I hope Grinder helps you achieve your best work.
